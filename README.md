# Unix Shell from Scratch in C

## Overview

This project is a simple Unix shell implemented in C, designed to emulate basic functionality of the command-line interface used in Unix-based systems. The shell can execute standard Unix commands and includes built-in commands such as `cd`, `exit`, and `help`. This project is part of my *Codects* series, where I explore various programming concepts and technologies through weekly projects.
